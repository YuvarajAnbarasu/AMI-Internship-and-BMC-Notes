# Server

## Definition
* A server is a computer or system that provides services, resources, or functionalities to other computers or devices, known as clients, over a network.
* It is designed to handle and respond to requests from clients, providing access to shared resources or performing specific tasks.

## Purpose
* Servers serve various purposes, depending on the specific type and role they fulfill.
* They can host websites, store and deliver files, manage databases, provide email services, handle network communication, perform calculations, and more.
* Servers enable centralized management, resource consolidation, and efficient sharing of resources across multiple clients.

## Hardware
* Server hardware is typically designed to be more robust, reliable, and scalable than regular desktop computers.
* Servers often includes features such as redundant power supplies, multiple network interfaces, high-capacity storage, and advanced cooling mechanisms.
* Servers may be standalone machines or exist in the form of rack-mounted units, blade servers, or even virtualized instances running on a cloud infrastructure.
  
## Operating System
* Servers run specialized operating systems optimized for server tasks, such as Windows Server, Linux distributions (e.g., CentOS, Ubuntu Server), or UNIX variants (e.g., Solaris).
* Server operating systems provide features like stability, security, scalability, remote management, and support for server-oriented software and services.


## Server Types
* File Servers: Store and manage files, enabling clients to access and share them over a network.
* Web Servers: Host websites and deliver web pages to clients using protocols like HTTP.
* Database Servers: Manage and store databases, allowing clients to query and manipulate data.
* Mail Servers: Handle email communications, managing sending, receiving, and storage of email messages.
* Application Servers: Provide a platform for running and managing applications accessible to clients.
* Game Servers: Host multiplayer online games, managing game sessions and player interactions.


## Client-Server Model
* The client-server model is a fundamental concept in server architecture.
* Clients make requests for services or resources, and servers respond to these requests.
* Servers handle multiple client connections simultaneously, managing resources, processing requests, and delivering responses.

## Server Administrators & Management
* Servers require ongoing administration and management to ensure their smooth operation.
* This includes tasks like configuration, security, monitoring, performance optimization, backups, and updates.
* System administrators or IT professionals are responsible for managing servers and ensuring their availability and reliability.

Servers play a crucial role in modern computing by providing centralized services, data storage, and resource sharing. Their versatility and ability to handle multiple clients make them essential components of networked systems and infrastructure.
