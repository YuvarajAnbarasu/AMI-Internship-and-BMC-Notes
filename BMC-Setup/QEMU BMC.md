# QEMU BMC

## Definition:
* QEMU BMC refers to the Baseboard Management Controller emulation in QEMU, an open-source virtualization software that allows running virtual machines on various host platforms. It provides functionalities and protocols for emulating virtual BMCs to manage and monitor virtual machines remotely.

## Out-of-Band Management:
* QEMU BMC enables out-of-band management capabilities for virtual machines, allowing remote access and control even if the guest operating system is not running or accessible.

## Purpose and Benefits:
* QEMU BMC facilitates remote management and monitoring of virtual machines, enhancing flexibility and reducing the need for direct interaction with VMs.
* It supports proactive monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting, leading to improved VM health and reduced downtime.
* Comprehensive management capabilities, including sensor emulation, event logging, and remote console access.

## Architecture:
* QEMU BMC integrates with QEMU virtual machines, providing virtual BMC functionality to interact with management software through supported protocols.

## Key Features and Functionalities:
* Sensor Emulation: QEMU BMC emulates virtual sensors within VMs, such as virtual temperature, voltage, and fan speed, allowing real-time monitoring and alerting.
* Event Logging: Maintains virtual event logs, recording system events, errors, and warnings, facilitating diagnostics and tracking VM health.
* Remote Console Access: Provides remote console access for VM configuration, OS installations, troubleshooting, and recovery tasks.
* Remote Power Control: Administrators can remotely power on, off, or restart virtual machines.
* Security: QEMU BMC includes security features like authentication and access control to ensure secure remote management.

## QEMU BMC Usage:
* QEMU BMC is commonly used in virtualization environments, cloud computing, and development and testing of virtual machines.

**Note:**
QEMU BMC is an emulated BMC specifically designed for virtual machines in the QEMU virtualization environment. It is essential to differentiate it from physical BMC implementations used in real hardware systems. Detailed documentation for QEMU BMC usage and configuration should be referred to for specific deployment and management details in virtual environments.
