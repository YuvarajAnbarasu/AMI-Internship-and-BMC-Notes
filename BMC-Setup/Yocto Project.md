# Yocto Project

## Definition:
Yocto Project BMC refers to the implementation of a Baseboard Management Controller using the Yocto Project, an open-source collaboration project that provides tools to build custom Linux-based embedded systems.

## Out-of-Band Management:

* Yocto Project BMC allows out-of-band management capabilities, enabling remote management, monitoring, and control of embedded systems built with Yocto Project.

## Purpose and Benefits:

* Yocto Project BMC facilitates remote management and monitoring of Yocto-based embedded systems, enhancing system availability and reducing the need for physical access.
* It enables proactive monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting, leading to improved system health and reduced downtime.
* Comprehensive management capabilities, including sensor monitoring, event logging, and remote console access.

## Architecture:

Yocto Project BMC integrates with Yocto-built embedded systems, and communication with management software occurs through supported protocols.

## Key Features and Functionalities:

* **Sensor Monitoring:** Yocto Project BMC allows access to embedded sensors for real-time monitoring and alerting.
* **Event Logging:** Maintains event logs to record system events, errors, and warnings for diagnostics and tracking hardware health.
* **Remote Console Access:** Provides remote console access for configuration, OS installations, troubleshooting, and recovery tasks.
* **Remote Power Control:** Administrators can remotely power on, off, or restart Yocto-based embedded systems.
* **Security:** Security mechanisms like authentication and access control are integral to Yocto Project BMC to ensure secure remote management.

## Yocto Project BMC Usage:

* Yocto Project BMC is employed in various industries for managing Yocto-built embedded systems, such as IoT devices, industrial automation, and telecommunications
