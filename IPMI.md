# IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface)

## Definition
* IPMI is a standardized interface protocol that defines a set of commands, functions, and protocols for managing and monitoring computer systems, specifically the hardware components.
* IPMI provides out-of-band management capabilities, allowing administrators to remotely monitor, control, and troubleshoot servers, even if the main operating system is unresponsive or offline.
* A key thing to note about IPMI is that IPMI is not human-readable unless you install IPMI extensions.

## Purpose and Benefits
* IPMI enables remote management and monitoring of server hardware, enhancing system availability, and reducing the need for physical access to the server.
* IPMI facilitates proactive monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting, leading to improved system health and reduced downtime.
* IPMI supports remote power control, sensor monitoring, event logging, and remote console access, providing comprehensive management capabilities.

## Architecture
* IPMI consists of three main components: the BMC (Baseboard Management Controller), the management software, and the IPMI protocol.
* The management software communicates with the BMC using the IPMI protocol, allowing administrators to interact with the server remotely.
